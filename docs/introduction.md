# Introduction
Tilengine is a free, cross-platform 2D graphics engine for creating classic/retro games with tile maps, sprites and palettes. Its unique scanline-based rendering algorithm makes raster effects a core feature, a technique used by many games running on real 2D graphics chips. This engine brings back the 16-bit era in its full glory and pushes it even further!
